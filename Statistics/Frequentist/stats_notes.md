### Definitions
- Independent events: two events, A and B, are independent if the fact that A occurs does not affect the probability of B occurring.
- Conditional probability: the probability that one event occurs given that another has occurred is called conditional probability. 
- P(A ∪ B) = Probability of events A or B (Union)
- P(A ∩ B) = Probability of events A and B (Intersection)
- P(A|B) = Probability of event A given event B

### Two mutually exclusive events A and B:
- P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)
- P(A ∩ B) = 0
- P(A|B) = 0 or P(B|A) = 0
- A and B are dependent
### Two Independent events A and B:
- P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B)
- P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)

### The formula for conditional probability is:      
- P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(A)
